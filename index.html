          <H2>About Me</H2>
          <p>I graduated, at the top of my class in Harvard, and have been a CFO for 10 years.
              I've worked for companies such as Microsoft,Amazon, and Google doing their taxes each year.I also have
              to do my own, so I know how to help a business with their problems, but also can help the individual.
              Over the years I've taken countless hours of continued education to keep current with tax laws, and this 
              will be vital to you.
